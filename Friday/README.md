# Friday Tutorials (Simulation of LiF Dissociation using RETIS and FFS):

To run this LiF dissociation simulation, with either RETIS or FFS, we will need to access a directory that allows for more storage than the home directory can provide. 

- If you are new to this workshop, you will need to create a directory in the “ocean” directory. To this please run the following command: 

  - “$ mkdir /ocean/projects/see220002p/$(whoami)”

- Then navigate to your Ocean directory by using the following command:
  
  - “$ cd /ocean/projects/see220002p/$(whoami)” 

- Once there, please copy over the files you would need for the demonstration today by running the following command: 
  
  - “$ cp -r ~/[YOUR iCoMSE DIRECTORY]/Friday/* ."

You should see two directories:

- LiF-RETIS: [Readme.txt](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZmcKZ1IfSJoPowOvZbf-U9q_t0PGVA3hwY1i7q1FC8M/edit?usp=sharing)

- LiF-FFS:
