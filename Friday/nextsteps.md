#  What to do next?

## Readings on advanced sampling methods
 - The big review:[Enhanced Sampling Methods for Molecular Dynamics Simulations [Article v1.0]](https://livecomsjournal.org/index.php/livecoms/article/view/v4i1e1583)
   - This review is part of LiveCoMS, and attemps to systemetize.  It is rather extensive, with over 400 references so far!

## Useful Software Tools

- PLUMED
  - PLUMED is the code that was discussed 
- PLUMED next
  - 
- WESTPA
  - 
- [pymbar](https://pymbar.readthedocs.io/)
  - A set of functions for calculating free energies between states and removing biases using multistate reweighting.
- [alchemlyb](https://alchemlyb.readthedocs.io/)
  - a wrapper library to make it easy to parse output from molecular simulation programs into pymbar and other free energy calculation routines, as well as interact usefully with the analysis coming out of this software.

## Cutting edge questions

- How to find better collective variables?
