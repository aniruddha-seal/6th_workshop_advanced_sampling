# Setting up software for this i-CoMSE workshop:

## Official invitees

* You should test your connection for Bridges2, which we will be using as the primary computing resources.  We will be accessing the system in two ways: running a Jupyter notebook, and directly running 

### Logging in via SSH

Use ssh to connect to Bridges-2 using ACCESS credentials and (optionally, if you have it set up) DUO MFA:

* Using your ssh client, use your ACCESS credentials and connect to hostname bridges2.psc.edu.

* ```ssh access-username@bridges2.psc.edu```
* Enter your ACCESS password when prompted.
* If you are registered with ACCESS DUO, you will receive a prompt on your device.  Once you have approved it, you will be logged in.

* If you have a previous Pittsburg supercomputing password, you may login using this password, but you will be using your own computational resources. 

### Logging in as a Jupyter Notebook via on-demand.

* To connect to Bridges-2 via OnDemand, point your browser to https://ondemand.bridges2.psc.edu.

* You will be prompted for a username and password.  Enter your your access username prefixed with 'access-' and your ACCESS password.  i.e. if your access password is amy3, then use the username 'access-amy3'. 

*  The OnDemand Dashboard will open.  From this page, you can use the menus across the top of the page to manage files and submit jobs to Bridges-2.
To end your OnDemand session, choose Log Out at the top right of the Dashboard window and close your browser.

* Other stuff.
