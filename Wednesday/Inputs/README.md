# Systems of interest
In this session, we consider two the following two systems.

## NaCl system
The NaCl system is used in Exercises 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, in which the general goal is to run advanced sampling methods to get the PMF/free energy surface of NaCl as a function of the ion-pair distance. In the folder `NaCl`, input files `NaCl.gro`, `NaCl.top` and `MD-NPT.mdp` are provided. These files were copied from [here](https://github.com/valsson-group/masterclass-22-11/tree/main/SetupSystem), with `NaCl.gro` being the same as the file `NaCl_StartingStructure-1.gro`. Note that in `MD-NPT.mdp`, smaller cutoffs are used to allow a small water box, hence a short time to finish the simulations in the tutorials. 

## 4-site system
The 4-site system is only used in Exercise 5. This is a toy model composed of 4 linearly connected interaction sites. As shown in the presentation, there are two torsional metastable states (cis and trans) for this system.
