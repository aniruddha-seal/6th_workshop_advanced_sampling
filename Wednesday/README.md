## Outline
Here is the outline of this session, which alternatives between lecture sections (presented with the slides [here](https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling/blob/main/Wednesday/enhanced_sampling_workshop.pdf)) and hands-on exercises:
- Introduction to High-Performing Computing (HPC) systems (pages 1 and 2 in the slides)
- [Exercise 1](https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling/tree/main/Wednesday/Exercise_1): Performing decoupled MD simulations in parallel
- Introduction to umbrella sampling (pages 3 and 4 in the slides)
- [Exercise 2](https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling/tree/main/Wednesday/Exercise_2): Umbrella sampling
- Introduction to multiple walkers metadynamics (page 5 in the slides)
- [Exercise 3](https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling/blob/main/Wednesday/Exercise_3/multi_metadynamics.ipynb): Multiple walkers metadynamics
- Introduction to temperature and Hamiltonian replica exchange (pages 6 to 8 in the slides) 
- [Exercise 4](https://github.com/icomse/3rd_workshop_advanced_sampling/blob/main/Wednesday/Exercise_4/HREMD.ipynb): Hamiltonian replica exchange
- Introduction to other replica exchange methods and hybrid methods (pages 9 and 10 in the slides)
